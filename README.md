Sentiment analysis of 10,000 ‘Rotten Tomatoes’ movie reviews based on Scikit-learn and NLTK libraries, constructing feature engineering by TF-IDF text vectorisation and combining lexical annotation with a sentiment lexicon; using SVM (RBF kernel, C=1.0) and Random Forest (n_estimators=500) for model training, and after optimisation with GridSearchCV tuning, the Random Forest model achieves 85.3% accuracy in 5-fold cross-validation (F1=0.84), an improvement of 7.3% compared to the baseline model; ANOVA analysis reveals that the length of the text and the frequency of the emotion words are the key features, and the accuracy is further improved by 5% for the fuzzy After optimising for fuzzy comments, the accuracy rate is increased by another 5%, and finally an efficient sentiment classification system is developed to provide data support for the analysis of user feedback on movie shelves.
